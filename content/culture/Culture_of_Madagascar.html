                                        <p>Occupying the northern part of the Great Island, the Antakarana are primarily
                                            found between Ambilobe and Cap d'Ambre, in
                                            the Antakarana mountain range.</p>
                                        <h5>Origin and geographical location.</h5>
                                        <p>The Antakarana, or "those who inhabit the Tsingy," originally were Sakalava
                                            people who migrated to the north in the 17th
                                            century. The choice of region was not accidental. Indeed, the site allowed
                                            them to escape potential attackers and find
                                            refuge in the thousands of caves and Tsingy formations in the mountain
                                            range. <br> <br>

                                            The region has been the scene of many conflicts, both between the Antakarana
                                            and neighboring ethnic groups and
                                            internally, as people vie for power. King Tsimiaro III currently rules over
                                            the entire kingdom. Despite these various
                                            tensions, the Antakarana remain united in their customs and traditions,
                                            where respect for ancestors and traditions is
                                            scrupulously observed.</p>
                                        <h5>Customs and traditions.</h5>
                                        <p>Parmi les us et coutumes les plus observés chez les Antakarana, le «
                                            Tsangantsaigny » ou cérémonie du couronnement du
                                            mât royal donne lieu à une grande festivité marquant la continuité de la
                                            monarchie. Cette grande cérémonie s’effectue
                                            tous les 5 ans en présence du roi et de tout le peuple Antakarana. Avant la
                                            cérémonie, le roi se rend à l’île Nosy
                                            Mitsio où est enterré le roi Tsimiharo puis dans les grottes sacrées. Nosy
                                            Mitsio fut en effet le dernier refuge et
                                            tombe de cet ancien roi Antakarana lors de l’invasion des Merina dans la
                                            région. <br> <br>

                                            Durant la cérémonie, le mât est remplacé par deux troncs mâle et femelle de
                                            Hazoambo, coupés et taillés sur place dans
                                            la forêt. Il est ensuite amené à Ambilobe pour être assemblé et aspergé de
                                            miel et d’alcool puis enduit de graisse. De
                                            l’abattage à l’assemblement, cette procédure peut durer 10 jours. Une fois
                                            le mât élevé, sont fixés au sommet du mât :
                                            le drapeau national et le drapeau du roi. A noter que cet évènement donne
                                            lieu également à une circoncision collective. <br><br>

                                            Il est interdit lors de ces festivités de mettre un chapeau ou d’enfiler
                                            chaussures, et le port de pagne est obligatoire

                                        <p>In daily life, the royal pole holds an important place among the Antakarana.
                                            Indeed, it is believed to possess powers
                                            and is greatly feared by the population. To ask for protection or justice,
                                            anyone can go to the foot of the pole and
                                            make their request. During major festivities, only sacred dances (the
                                            "Rebika") are performed, where dancers execute a
                                            warrior-inspired choreography while holding a rifle. As for circumcision, it
                                            must be done before the age of 7. The
                                            Antakarana primarily engage in fishing and cattle breeding.</p>

                                        <p>In the northwest of Madagascar, the Tsimihety occupy an enclosed region
                                            bordered by the Sihanaka, Antakarana,
                                            Betsimisaraka, and Sakalava.</p>
                                        <h5>Origin and geographical location.</h5>
                                        <p>An ethnic group established in the northwest of Madagascar, the Tsimihety, or
                                            "those who do not cut their hair," occupy
                                            an enclosed region bordered by the Sihanaka to the south, the Antakarana to
                                            the north, the Betsimisaraka to the east,
                                            and the Sakalava to the west. <br> <br>

                                            According to oral tradition, the Tsimihety are called so because they
                                            refused to cut their hair, as tradition dictates,
                                            after the death of a king. Historically, they are said to be the descendants
                                            of European pirates who came ashore on the
                                            island and later mixed with the "Vazimba," the first people to have lived in
                                            Madagascar. <br> <br>

                                            Despite their isolation, the Tsimihety have never submitted to any other
                                            ethnic group, fiercely defending their
                                            independence. However, due to their geographical location near other ethnic
                                            groups, they have been greatly influenced by
                                            their customs and traditions. <br><br>

                                            Thus, there are some similarities, with the most common being circumcision
                                            and ancestor worship. Their dialect is also a
                                            clever blend of dialects borrowed from neighboring ethnic groups. The
                                            Tsimihety people are primarily focused on rice
                                            cultivation and livestock farming, practicing subsistence agriculture but
                                            also engaging in trade with other ethnic
                                            groups. <br><br>

                                            Port-Bergé, Mampikony, Mandritsara, Antsohihy, Befandriana, and Bealanana
                                            today mark the traditional territory of the
                                            Tsimihety.</p>

                                        </h5>
                                        <p>The Tsimihety have their own customs, like other ethnic groups in Madagascar.
                                            Their traditional song is the "Kôro," sung
                                            during major events. <br><br>

                                            A portion of the Tsimihety living in the west practice "tromba," a rite
                                            involving trances to invoke a spirit, typically
                                            that of a deceased king. This is not a Tsimihety custom originally but one
                                            borrowed from the Sakalava. The ceremony
                                            takes place in a house called "Zomba," where dances and songs accompanied by
                                            marine trumpets are performed under the
                                            supervision of a "saha" or medium. It is worth noting that the Tsimihety are
                                            the only ethnic group not governed by a
                                            king but by wise individuals called "Sojabe." <br><br>

                                            The practice of "tromba" is still very much alive during the annual
                                            festivals held in the "doany" or royal sacred
                                            sanctuaries of the Sakalava. As for marriage ceremonies, numerous rites are
                                            observed. For example, the young man wishing
                                            to marry must first build his own future home and then present his chosen
                                            one to his parents. While collateral unions
                                            are forbidden, the Tsimihety of Mandritsara permit them starting from the
                                            third generation. Other prohibitions still
                                            apply: marrying someone from the "Kelihantsy" clan, considered cursed, is
                                            prohibited.</p>

                                        <h5>Origin and geographical location.</h5>

                                        <p>In the 18th century, the Antesaka, originating from the marshy regions of the
                                            southeastern part of the Great Island, are
                                            said to have migrated to this area and took the name "Sihanaka" once
                                            settled. However, the question of their origin is
                                            contradicted by local tradition. Some argue that the Sihanaka are originally
                                            from the Masianaka region and, to escape
                                            conflicts, migrated to the Alaotra Lake. Known for their large-scale rice
                                            cultivation, the region occupied by this
                                            ethnic group is now considered <b>the largest rice granary of
                                                Madagascar.</b></p>

                                        <h5>Customs and traditions</h5>

                                        <p>Various rites are practiced by the Sihanaka people, most of which are related
                                            to agriculture. Ritual ceremonies are held
                                            to request annual rainfall for rice cultivation, as well as to seek
                                            protection and blessings for the inhabitants. <br><br>

                                            The "Doany" are sacred places, as they are the tombs of the legendary
                                            founder of the city around 1600, his nephew, and
                                            his son, and must be maintained. This obligation is strictly observed, as
                                            otherwise, it is said that the normal cycle of
                                            rainfall would be disturbed. It is worth noting that the ethnicity also
                                            practices ancestor worship, and their tombs
                                            consist of a mound of earth adorned with a long funeral pole or a shorter
                                            pole supporting a zebu skull and sometimes
                                            figurines. Funeral mannequins, or "sary," are erected above the tombs.
                                            <br><br>

                                            For each event, participants wear specific attire and follow certain
                                            ancestral rules. Known as "Volam-bita" and
                                            "Sarabe," these are sanctification ceremonies involving communication with
                                            the spirits of the deceased through the
                                            sacrifice of a zebu. The "Sarabe" is more important than the "Volam-bita" as
                                            it requires, among other things, the
                                            presence of the "tangalamena," local kings, for festivities that can last up
                                            to three days. <br><br>

                                            The "Sarabe" or "Joro orana" may be performed to ask for the ancestors'
                                            blessing for a good rainy season and, therefore,
                                            good harvests. Another custom among the Sihanaka is that a young boy can
                                            only be circumcised after the ritual ceremony
                                            of "famoahan-jaza andohan'omby," meaning after the child has passed over the
                                            head of a zebu. This ceremony is followed
                                            by three days of festivities, leading to public rejoicing.

                                        <p>In the past, the Sihanaka people built huts made of reed near the water, then
                                            began moving further away to settle on the
                                            hills surrounding the lake. The dwellings are typically constructed with
                                            clay or terracotta. Besides rice farming, they
                                            also practice subsistence farming, such as growing maize, cassava,
                                            vegetables, and peanuts. Known for being excellent
                                            fishermen and specialists in irrigated rice cultivation, more and more
                                            families are also getting involved in livestock
                                            farming (turkeys, geese, ducks, etc.). <br><br>

                                            The month of June is a prosperous time for the region, as production is at
                                            its peak, marking the beginning of various
                                            festivals, such as ancestor worship and circumcision ceremonies (from June

                                            Antalaha.</p>
                                        <h5>Origin and geographical location</h5>
                                        <p>The Betsimisaraka, an ethnic group occupying the eastern coast of Madagascar
                                            from Mananjary to Antalaha, were born under
                                            the leadership of Ratsimilaho. He united various communities along this
                                            coastline to face the Europeans who came for the
                                            slave trade in the 17th and 18th centuries. <br><br>

                                            A true confederation, the Betsimisaraka were composed of the Antavaratra in
                                            the north, the Antatsimo in the south, and
                                            the Varimo in the center. These are distinct peoples, each with their own
                                            languages and cultures, which now contribute
                                            to the richness of the Betsimisaraka. <br><br>

                                            The territory spans 72,000 km² with 15 administrative capitals. The
                                            Betsimisaraka region was the site of many conflicts,
                                            both among the peoples scattered along the eastern coast and against the
                                            slave traders, pirates, the prevailing
                                            monarchy, and eventually the European colonizers. Many remnants of these
                                            events can still be seen today through local
                                            customs and traditions. <br><br>

                                            It is important to note that the Betsimisaraka are a sedentary people, with
                                            primary activities focused on fishing,
                                            agriculture, and, more recently, handicrafts. Historically, the capital was
                                            Fénérive Est before becoming Tamatave, due
                                            to political and economic reasons related to its port.</p>

                                        <h5>Customs and traditions</h5>
                                        <p>Although some customs differ within this heterogeneous people, the
                                            celebration of the Day of the Dead remains a time of
                                            gathering for the entire Betsimisaraka ethnic group. Thus, throughout the
                                            month of November, not just on the 1st of the
                                            month, there is a large influx to the Atsinanana region, considered the land
                                            of the ancestors and the homeland of all.
                                            This is a very festive period during which, depending on each family's
                                            means, the "famadihana" or turning of the dead is
                                            performed to ask for blessings and protection from the ancestors. It is also
                                            an opportunity for each family to reunite
                                            and strengthen their family bonds. <br><br>

                                            During the celebrations, the Dihy Telo is performed. This is a special dance
                                            where women sing and dance to the rhythm of
                                            drums and accordions, wearing brightly colored shirts and dresses, and
                                            adorned with hats. It is worth noting that in the
                                            past, the Betsimisaraka mainly wore clothing made of woven reeds, such as
                                            skirts, tunics, and, of course, hats. Besides
                                            ancestor worship, other customs remain very much alive, such as the To-laza,
                                            a collective circumcision ceremony held
                                            over 15 days during the austral winter, which leads to large celebrations.

                                        <h5>Origin and geographical location</h5>
                                        <p>The Sakalava are a cultural group that was formed by several ethnicities in
                                            the 17th century. Later, there was a
                                            successive migration of families from Isaka, in the southeast of Madagascar,
                                            until they were permanently settled in this
                                            large region of the western part of the island. <br><br>

                                            The founder of the Sakalava kingdom was a prince named Maroserana.
                                            Afterward, the kingdom split into two parts: Menabe
                                            and Boina. Menabe is home to one of the largest ethnic communities in
                                            Madagascar. <br><br>

                                            Like all peoples who practice ancestor worship, funeral art is important to
                                            the Sakalava. The tombs are primarily made
                                            of wood, sometimes decorated with erotic statues symbolizing procreation,
                                            the continuity of life after death, and with
                                            bull skulls. The Sakalava hold a particular belief based on ten essential
                                            points, with respect for a higher power,
                                            ancestors, the stars, and "fihavanana" being the foundation. They practice
                                            various rites called "fomba," and like all
                                            ethnic groups, they have their own customs and traditions. The bathing of
                                            royal relics, both for the Sakalava of Menabe
                                            and those of Boina, is one such rite, as are the circumcisions, or
                                            "savatse."</p>

                                            The deceased rulers are consulted by the Sakalava through a "mpitaiza"
                                            (spiritual medium), who facilitates communication
                                            with the spirits to intervene in their daily lives and during ceremonies,
                                            offering advice and messages. This is the
                                            ritual of "tromba" or trance, a rite that also marks the close relationship
                                            between the living and the dead. The
                                            ceremony of bathing the royal relics is called "Fitampoha" in Menabe and
                                            "Fanompoambe" in Boina. These ceremonies take
                                            place at different times and each has its own specificities.

                                        <h5>Daily life</h5>
                                        <p>In terms of clothing, men wear a "lambahoany" around their waist. Women wear
                                            two lambahoan, with the first wrapped
                                            around their waist and the second around their head. <br><br>

                                            The Sakalava graze their zebu herds in the savannah and cultivate maize,
                                            rice, and cassava in the valleys. They live in
                                            huts, with two types: the **trano vondro**, made of wood and reeds, and the
                                            stilted hut, made of wood. The Sakalava are
                                            agro-pastoralists. They raise zebu cattle and practice subsistence farming,
                                            growing rice, maize, and cassava. <br><br>

                                            In Morondava, the capital of Menabe, the inhabitants also rely on fishing.
                                            However, the lifestyle is different, and for
                                            some, livestock farming is no longer the primary activity.</p>

                                        <p>An ethnic group occupying the northern region of the Highlands of Madagascar,
                                            the Merina, or "Those of the heights," are
                                            of Malay and Indonesian origin.</p>
                                        <h5>Origin and geographical location</h5>
                                        <p>Initially, the people settled in the rich valleys of the Sisaony and Ikopa
                                            rivers, forming the Imerina valley. They
                                            quickly expanded into a large kingdom under the reign of Andrianjaka and the
                                            various kings and queens who succeeded him. <br><br>

                                            The capital was later named "Imerina Ambaniandro," meaning the highland
                                            country under the sun, before becoming
                                            "Antananarivo," or the city of a thousand. Historically, during
                                            Andrianjaka's reign, the construction of the first
                                            "Rova" (fortress) was guarded by a thousand men, hence the city of a
                                            thousand. The Merina, as the most populous ethnic
                                            group compared to all others on the island, have shaped the country's
                                            history through the numerous expeditions they led
                                            across Madagascar. <br><br>

                                            Due to their location, the Merina were the first to open up to foreigners,
                                            seeking knowledge from them and also
                                            assisting in their quest for conquest. The capital of Madagascar,
                                            Antananarivo, consists of six regions: Avaradrano,
                                            Vakinisisaony, Marovatana, Vonizongo, Imamo, and Vakinankaratra.</p>

                                        <h5>Customs and traditions.</h5>
                                        <p>The Merina practice ancestor worship and circumcision, which is rooted in
                                            Austronesian culture. Regarding ancestor
                                            worship, or "Famadihana," the remains are periodically exhumed from the
                                            family tomb, followed by a great celebration.
                                            The remains are then covered with a new shroud or "lamba mena" before being
                                            returned to their place. This is an
                                            opportunity for the family to strengthen bonds, meet newcomers, and reaffirm
                                            their belonging. <br><br>

                                            Circumcisions, the turning of the dead, or other important events, such as
                                            the celebration of the Malagasy New Year, or
                                            "Asaramanitra," are marked by more or less popular festivities, during which
                                            "Hira gasy" (traditional music), "kabary"
                                            (speeches), "Dihy" (dances), and "joro" (zebu sacrifices) are performed.
                                            <br><br>

                                            Another custom still preserved today is the traditional marriage ceremony.
                                            According to tradition, the
                                            "fanateram-bodiondry" marks the engagement ceremony, which includes the
                                            "kabary" (speech). Three envelopes are then
                                            offered to the bride’s family: the first contains various banknotes and
                                            coins, the second contains the "ala volo fotsy"
                                            specifically for the father, and finally the "tsaka rano." A dowry is given
                                            to the bride by her family during the
                                            wedding (furniture, kitchen utensils, etc.).

                                            the "Hova" (commoners), and the "Mainty," who
                                            are considered slaves and servants or "Andevo." The Merina are both farmers
                                            and livestock breeders.

                                        <p>The Bezanozano are mainly concentrated in the city of Moramanga. Their
                                            kingdom once extended beyond the Angavo cliff to

                                            The Bezanozano were organized into small clans that, to protect themselves
                                            from various threats and internal conflicts,
                                            built their fortified villages on hilltops. An independent people, the

                                        <h5>Customs and Traditions</h5>
                                        <p>A people deeply attached to various traditions, the Bezanozano observe many
                                            customs, especially concerning pregnant
                                            women. For example, it is strictly forbidden for pregnant women to sit on
                                            the doorstep. They must also avoid looking at
                                            ugly or repulsive things to prevent their child from being born with
                                            deformities. Childbirth takes place in the presence
                                            of female relatives and the husband. Afterward, the mother returns to her
                                            family of origin for a lunar month before
                                            rejoining her household. <br><br>

                                            Among the Bezanozano, a child is not fully accepted into the clan until they
                                            have had their first haircut and undergone
                                            circumcision. Another significant custom is the use of sacred poles called
                                            "Tsikafana," topped with zebu horns. These
                                            poles, traditionally erected in each village, serve as a tribute for a
                                            fulfilled wish or a way to commemorate an
                                            important event, symbolizing the protection of the "razana" or ancestors.

                                        <h5>Daily Life</h5>
                                        <p>While many villages are still located on hilltops, most modern homes today
                                            are built on the plains, mainly concentrated
                                            in Moramanga. The Bezanozano people, known for their physical strength, were
                                            once responsible for supplying the capital,
                                            Antananarivo, by carrying goods on their backs. Most families are livestock
                                            farmers and rice cultivators, specializing
                                            in rice farming. <br><br>

                                            As a crossroads city connecting the East Coast, Alaotra-Mangoro, and
                                            Antananarivo, Moramanga is a vibrant town where
                                            many travelers regularly stop before continuing their journey. During the
                                            colonial era, the town was a major slave
                                            trading post, but today, it is known for its thriving vegetable market.
                                            These fresh products come from the surrounding
                                            villages and are sold at very affordable prices. <br><br>

                                            The proximity of the Andasibe-Mantadia National Park has also contributed to
                                            the economic growth of the region, as many
                                            visitors come annually and seek accommodation in Moramanga.</p>

                                        <p>Descendants of a union between Indonesian conquerors who came to seize the
                                            southeastern part of the Great Island and
                                            the Vazimba, the indigenous people, the Betsileo established four kingdoms
                                            to consolidate their positions and
                                            protect their lands: Manandriana, Arindrano, Lalangina, and Isandra. Despite
                                            belonging to the same ethnic group,
                                            internal rivalries ultimately weakened the entire kingdom, making it easier
                                            for the Merina to dominate them. One by
                                            one, the Betsileo kings were subdued between the 17th and 18th centuries.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>The Betsileo society was governed by four different castes: the Hova
                                            (nobles), the Andehova (servants of the Hova,
                                            considered free men), the Olom’potsy (common people), and the Andevo
                                            (slaves, either by social downfall or war
                                            capture). In each Betsileo village, traditional chiefs called Ray aman-dreny
                                            ensured that traditions were respected
                                            and were regarded as wise elders. They played an important role in
                                            circumcision ceremonies and, most notably, in
                                            ancestral worship rituals.</p>

                                        <p>Every village also had a Mpimasy (diviner) and an Ombiasy (sorcerer). The
                                            Mpimasy was recognized as a healer, while
                                            the Ombiasy, feared for his powers, could use them for both good and evil.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Customs and Traditions</h5>
                                        <p>Practicing ancestor worship and circumcision, the Betsileo follow specific
                                            rules during these rituals. As in all
                                            ethnic groups of Madagascar, the spirits of the ancestors continue to be
                                            respected but also feared.</p>

                                        <p>Among the Betsileo, it is mandatory for each household to have a dedicated
                                            space for the ancestors. During major
                                            occasions, the "ray aman-dreny" visit commemorative steles called "vatolahy"
                                            or "tatao" to invoke the spirits and
                                            ask for protection, blessings, or guidance. While circumcision and the
                                            turning of the dead are celebrated with great
                                            festivities, events such as a birth or even the construction of a new home
                                            are also significant occasions.</p>

                                        <p>According to Betsileo tradition, when invited to a celebration, it is
                                            customary to bring a small bag of rice to be
                                            offered to the "ray aman-dreny" of the house. It is also worth noting that
                                            the Betsileo practice the "Famindrana."
                                            In this ritual, the deceased is exhumed and placed in a new tomb, unlike the
                                            turning of the dead, where the body is
                                            exhumed, rewrapped in a new "lamba mena" or burial shroud, and then returned
                                            to its place.</p>
                                        <h5>Daily life</h5>
                                        <p>Due to its geographical location, serving as a crossroads between the Bara
                                            and Merina territories, the Betsileo have
                                            been able to take advantage of this proximity. Known for being excellent
                                            rice farmers, they have developed various
                                            irrigation systems, with most of their production intended for
                                            self-sufficiency.</p>

                                        <p>Zebus also play an important role in the daily life of the Betsileo, as they
                                            are used in farming. The practice of
                                            hillside subsistence farming helps them cope during food shortages, with
                                            crops such as cassava, sweet potatoes,
                                            maize, and potatoes. They also raise pigs and poultry, although zebu farming
                                            is associated with a higher social
                                            status among the Betsileo.</p>

                                        <p>A fierce people who valued their freedom above all else, the Tanala fought
                                            for their independence in Ikongo against
                                            the various ethnic groups surrounding their kingdom, including the Betsileo,
                                            Betsimisaraka, Antambahoaka, Antaimoro,
                                            and Antaisaka. As a forest-dwelling people, they took advantage of their
                                            geographical location not only to live
                                            freely but also to defend themselves against enemy attacks.</p>

                                        <p>According to oral tradition, they are believed to be descendants of the
                                            Vazimba, the indigenous people of Madagascar.
                                            Between the 13th and 17th centuries, various ethnic groups settled around
                                            the Ikongo massif, fleeing conflicts and
                                            seeking refuge at the base of the mountains, which remained the stronghold
                                            of the Tanala.</p>

                                        <p>In the 19th century, the Tanala fiercely resisted Merina attempts to conquer
                                            their land, successfully repelling them.
                                            To secure their peace and freedom, a pact was established between the Tanala
                                            and the French in 1898, and the Ikongo
                                            massif was renamed Fort Carnot. However, the kingdom eventually split into
                                            three: the Southern Antanala Kingdom, the
                                            Northern Antanala Kingdom, and, between them, the Kingdom of Ikongo.</p>

                                        <p>While the Northern Antanala were open to relations with the Merina and
                                            Betsileo, the Southern Antanala refused any
                                            allegiance to other ethnic groups and gradually distanced themselves from
                                            the Kingdom of Ikongo.</p>
                                        <h5>Customs and Traditions</h5>
                                        <p>A people deeply attached to their traditions, the Tanala observe various
                                            rites from birth to death. For example, in
                                            the case of an abnormal birth, the child is left to the will of the gods
                                            without receiving any special attention. If
                                            the child dies, they are buried without any ceremony and outside the family
                                            tomb, similar to the case of a newborn
                                            who dies shortly after birth.</p>

                                        <p>A child is only officially recognized three months later through a ceremony
                                            called "Mamoaka zaza," or the child's
                                            presentation. On this occasion, a zebu is sacrificed at the foot of a
                                            "vatolahy" or male stone, followed by great
                                            festivities. Circumcision follows the same ritual but with even more
                                            elaborate ceremonies and offerings to the
                                            ancestors.</p>

                                        <p>Regarding marriage, the Tanala of Ambohimanga allow unions between first
                                            cousins. However, the Tanala of the South
                                            and East prohibit marriages between the descendants of two brothers or two
                                            sisters, except for unions between the
                                            descendants of a brother and a sister. Upon death, a funeral vigil is held
                                            in the village chief’s house, where the
                                            deceased is laid out and covered with a shroud, or "lamba mena." The
                                            following day, they are taken to the family
                                            tomb, accompanied by various objects they cherished during their lifetime.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Daily life</h5>
                                        <p>The Tanala people practice slash-and-burn agriculture and also rely on
                                            hunting, fishing, and gathering for their
                                            livelihood. Living at high altitudes on the steep slopes of the Ikongo
                                            massif, the younger members of the community
                                            settle in the lower areas, while the homes of the elders are located higher
                                            up. Social life is hierarchical, and
                                            each village has a "Tranobe," which serves as a communal house. To
                                            distinguish themselves, all Tanala wear a small
                                            round hat!</p>

                                        <p>Living on the southeastern coast of Madagascar, the Antambahoaka, or "Those
                                            of the People," inhabit the
                                            Vatovavy-Fitovinany region in the province of Fianarantsoa.</p>
                                        <h5>Origin and Geographical Location</h5>
                                        <p>A small ethnic group established along the banks of the Mananjary River, the
                                            capital of the district of the same
                                            name, the history of the Antambahoaka dates back to the reign of Ravalarivo,
                                            affectionately nicknamed
                                            "Ratiambahoaka" by the people, which is believed to have given the name
                                            Antambahoaka to his descendants. The town of
                                            Mananjary was originally a village built in the 15th century, and the
                                            origins of this ethnic group can still be seen
                                            in traditions that remain strong today. Some customs related to Islam reveal
                                            the past presence of Arabs, as well as
                                            Africans and people from the East, who landed on Madagascar’s eastern coast
                                            between the 10th and 12th centuries.
                                            Their dialect also incorporates the Arabic language, and some members even
                                            master its writing.</p>

                                        <p>Like all ethnic groups in Madagascar, the Antambahoaka are governed by a
                                            king, who serves as the guardian of
                                            traditions and a wise figure deeply respected by the people. His palace is
                                            quite simple: built on stilts, the walls
                                            are made of falafa (woven palm leaves), and the roof is crafted from
                                            branches of the Ravinala, or "traveler’s tree."
                                            The floor is made from the bark of the Ravinala, and the house is easily
                                            recognizable by its rectangular shape, with
                                            a wooden-carved bird figure placed above the entrance.</p>

                                        <h5>Customs and Traditions</h5>

                                        <p>The Antambahoaka observe many traditions, including the Sambatra, which takes
                                            place every seven years. The king is
                                            recognizable by his traditional attire, consisting of a long robe with red
                                            and black stripes and a red chechia, the
                                            color of kings or "mpanjaka." A ritual festival whose celebrations can last
                                            from 15 days to a month, the Sambatra is
                                            primarily a commemoration of the journey made by Arab ancestors to
                                            Mananjary. It concludes with a collective
                                            circumcision, a moment of great festivity marked by traditional dances and
                                            abundant alcohol consumption. This event
                                            serves as an opportunity for the ethnic group to strengthen their sense of
                                            belonging and relationships, known as
                                            "Fihavanana."</p>

                                        <p>Beyond this festive period, the Antambahoaka are also known for their "fady"
                                            or taboos, the most significant being
                                            the birth of twins. Considered a curse, twins are now given to adoption
                                            associations, whereas in the past, they were
                                            abandoned in nature at birth. Some families choose to keep only one child
                                            and entrust the other to religious
                                            institutions.</p>

                                            coffee cultivation for export. They also
                                            practice subsistence farming and offer various products, including basketry
                                            and beekeeping products that vary
                                            according to the seasons. Antambahoaka women are renowned for their skill in
                                            weaving reeds, while the men also
                                            engage in fishing to supplement their income.</p>

                                        <p>The Antaimoro, also known as "those of the coast," settled on the
                                            southeastern coast of Madagascar following numerous
                                            and diverse Arab, African, Asian, and Indian expeditions between the 13th
                                            and 16th centuries.</p>

                                        <h5>Origin and geographical location</h5>
                                        <p>An ethnic group with diverse origins, the Antaimoro are subdivided into four
                                            distinct sub-ethnic groups: the
                                            Ampanabaka (the dominant group), the Anakara, the Antalaotra, and the
                                            Anteony. This last sub-group is known for its
                                            mastery of divination, astrology, and the Arabic script known as Sorabe.</p>

                                        <p>A peaceful people with a great sense of diplomacy, the Antaimoro were
                                            represented by Andriamazonoro during the reigns
                                            of King Andrianampoinimerina and Radama I. Like all ethnic groups in
                                            Madagascar, they have their own dialect, which
                                            is closely related to Malayo-Polynesian languages. In addition to mastering
                                            Sorabe (the Arabic alphabet), the
                                            Antaimoro are particularly known for their skill in creating the famous
                                            Antaimoro paper, made from the bark of the
                                            Havoha tree and decorated with dried flowers.</p>

                                        <p>Inhabiting the Matitana valley in the province of Fianarantsoa, the Antaimoro
                                            are primarily concentrated in the
                                            Vohipeno region, where various tombs of past kings can still be found. Their
                                            descendants continue to reign to this
                                            day.</p>
                                        <h5>Customs and Traditions</h5>

                                        <p>A deeply traditional ethnic group, the Antaimoro people often turn to their
                                            diviner, known as the "Ombiasy," during
                                            significant events or situations. The Ombiasy is believed to master the art
                                            of divination called "sikidy" as well as
                                            "Hasina," a science related to astrology. Also considered a healer, he is
                                            frequently sought by the Antaimoro people for
                                            advice and remedies. <br> <br>

                                            The kingdom is still governed today by the descendants of the first
                                            Antaimoro kings. Their customs and traditions remain
                                            very much alive and continue to be carried out according to ancestral
                                            recommendations recorded in Sorabe. <br> <br>

                                            Every year in December, a celebration in honor of the ancestors takes place
                                            in Vohipeno, featuring various offerings,
                                            including the sacrifice of a red-coated zebu. The ceremony is conducted with
                                            the reading of Sorabe, during which the
                                            zebu is sacrificed. This is followed by the maintenance of the royal tombs
                                            in an atmosphere of joy and festivity. <br> <br>

                                            Major ceremonies and celebrations—such as births, weddings, funerals, and
                                            exhumations—are performed according to strict
                                            rules. Regarding marriage, the groom is not allowed to choose a wife from a
                                            higher social rank than his own.</p>

                                        </p>

                                        <p>The Antaimoro are great cultivators, and Vohipeno stands out for its
                                            production of pepper and coffee for export, as well
                                            as seasonal exports of lychees. Although the population is primarily
                                            agricultural, the Antaimoro are also renowned for
                                            producing Antaimoro paper. Various workshops can be visited on-site to

                                            Madagascar</h5>
                                        <p>Counting among the 18 ethnic groups of Madagascar, the Antaifasy, or "those
                                            who live in the sands," are settled in the
                                            southeastern part of the Great Island, in the Farafangana region.</p>
                                        <h5>Origin and geographical location</h5>
                                        <p>Although this ethnic group is attributed to various origins (Egyptian,
                                            Polynesian, and Malaysian), it remains a people
                                            rich in traditions as well as a historical and cultural past. Originally
                                            settled in the southwest of Madagascar, the
                                            Antaifasy gradually migrated to the southeast in the 16th century to escape
                                            numerous tribal conflicts. <br> <br>

                                            Adopting the Islamic religion while maintaining their traditional beliefs,
                                            the Antaifasy also speak their own dialect,
                                            like other Malagasy ethnic groups. Successively governed by kings descended
                                            from Andriambolanony, the Antaifasy coexist
                                            peacefully with neighboring tribes, including the Bara, the Antanosy, the
                                            Antaimoro, and the Antaisaka.</p>
                                        <h5>Customs and Traditions</h5>

                                        <p>As with all other ethnic groups in Madagascar, traditional customs remain
                                            very much alive and are deeply embedded in
                                            daily life. Among the Antaifasy, strict laws govern funeral rites and social
                                            hierarchy to ensure the continuity of their
                                            traditions. <br><br>

                                            During a funeral ceremony, the deceased is buried deep in the forest along
                                            with their belongings, such as jewelry and
                                            weapons. The tomb is also decorated with various objects and frescoes
                                            depicting the life and social status of the
                                            deceased. <br> <br>

                                            In daily life, each village is governed by an authority composed of elders
                                            and a local chief, who are consulted for
                                            major decisions and conflict resolution. Highly respected figures among the
                                            Antaifasy include diviners and sorcerers.
                                            Their advice is sought before important events such as marriage, travel, or
                                            burial. They are also regarded as healers,
                                            providing remedies based on rituals and medicinal plants. <br> <br>

                                            Unlike other Malagasy ethnic groups, the Antaifasy do not have a specific
                                            annual commemoration. However, marriage and
                                            circumcision ceremonies are celebrated with grand festivities.</p>

                                        <h5>Daily life</h5>
                                        <p>In their daily lives, the Antaifasy rely on fishing and hunting for
                                            sustenance. They also practice subsistence farming
                                            and have ventured into export-oriented agriculture, particularly cultivating
                                            coffee and cloves. <br> <br>

                                            Although Farafangana is a coastal city, its port originally established
                                            during the colonial period by the French has
                                            lost much of its significance. Today, commercial exchanges are primarily
                                            conducted via road networks, notably the RN12,
                                            which connects Farafangana to Manakara and Vangaindrano, and the RN27, which
                                            links it to Ihosy. <br><br>

                                            The best time to visit the region is during the dry season (June to
                                            September), preferably with a 4x4 vehicle,
                                            especially if you plan to explore the area and the Manombo Special Reserve.

                                            Considered to be of Bantu origin, the Bara are believed to be descendants of
                                            an African named Rabiby, who arrived on an
                                            expedition to the south of the Great Island with more than a thousand men.

                                            Warriors at heart, the Bara have a deep passion for weapons as well as their
                                            livestock, which symbolize power,
                                            prosperity, and great pride! An independent people feared by most other
                                            ethnic groups in Madagascar, they fiercely
                                            defend their freedom at the cost of their lives. Their territory is said to
                                            be bounded by the Mangoky River to the
                                            south, extending north to Beroroha, passing through Midongy to the east and
                                            Sakaraha to the west. They are also
                                            concentrated in the Isalo Massif and Horombe.

                                        <h5>Customs and Traditions</h5>
                                        <p>The Bara custom dictates that, to demonstrate their bravery and attract young
                                            women, a Bara man must be able to steal a
                                            zebu! This ancestral tradition is accompanied by the “Ringa” or “Moraingy”,
                                            a form of bare-handed wrestling. This
                                            practice serves as training in case of hand-to-hand combat with an enemy.
                                            <br><br>

                                            In addition to bullfighting, which takes place in makeshift arenas during
                                            major celebrations, the Bara also practice the
                                            “Savatse”, a collective circumcision ritual. This ceremony marks the
                                            acceptance of male children into their clan and
                                            grants them the right to be buried in the family tomb. It is also the
                                            occasion for the “Papango” dance, where
                                            participants climb a wooden pole and imitate the flight of a hawk. <br><br>

                                            Like other Malagasy ethnic groups, the Bara also practice ancestor worship.
                                            The deceased are placed in coffins on
                                            wheels, decorated with three colors: red, black, and blue. These coffins are
                                            then laid in rock cavities made of flat
                                            stones, often in very hard-to-reach locations. Some parts of the Bara
                                            territory, such as the “Sacred Forest” in
                                            Tsaranoro and Karambony, are considered “fady” (taboo) and forbidden to
                                            outsiders. Only the families of the deceased may
                                            enter these sacred sites, particularly during the “Famadihana” (turning of
                                            the bones), which takes place every five
                                            years.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Daily life</h5>
                                        <p>In daily life, Bara men lead their herds in search of new pastures. Their
                                            cattle can number in the hundreds, and zebu
                                            theft is common! <br><br>

                                            Bara women, on the other hand, take care of the household and children. As
                                            water is scarce in the south, they may walk
                                            several kilometers to find a well, carrying the water back in buckets or
                                            gourds. <br><br>

                                            Children are raised with deep respect for traditions. While some now attend
                                            public school, they are introduced to zebu
                                            herding from a young age.</p>

                                        </h5>
                                        <p>A people established in the southeast of Madagascar and living mainly in the
                                            district of Vangaindrano, along the banks
                                            of the Mananara and Itonamy rivers, the Antaisaka were once known as brave
                                            and formidable warriors.</p>
                                        <h5>Origin and geographical location</h5>
                                        <p>Historically, the king of the Sakalava Menabe kingdom, Andriamandresy, set
                                            out to find new lands not to expand his
                                            kingdom but to create a new one: the Antaisaka kingdom. He later died in a
                                            battle against the Betsileo and was taken
                                            back to his homeland by the victors. <br><br>

                                            As seasoned warriors, the Antaisaka were so feared that in the 19th century,
                                            Queen Ranavalona I decided to subdue them
                                            by sending no fewer than 9,000 men from the capital. Etymologically,
                                            Antaisaka means "Those from the Sakalava land," and
                                            they are often mistaken for the Sakalava of Menabe. The Antaisaka people
                                            consist of different tribes that share the same
                                            ancestor, which facilitated their unification. During the colonial period,
                                            the Antaisaka were recruited as agricultural
                                            workers as well as laborers.</p>
                                        <h5>Customs and Traditions</h5>
                                        <p>A people deeply attached to its numerous ancestral traditions, the Antaisaka
                                            practice ancestor worship in a grand and
                                            festive atmosphere. They follow the ritual of double burial, meaning that in
                                            the region, you will find many temporary
                                            graves where bodies are initially buried. After two or three years, the
                                            remains are exhumed and transferred to the
                                            "kibory", or collective tombs, for their final resting place. <br><br>

                                            Another characteristic of this ethnic group is the observance of various
                                            "fady" or taboos. For example, you will never
                                            see an Antaisaka working on someone else's land or requesting money in
                                            exchange for labor. Another significant "fady"
                                            concerns dogs, which the Antaisaka consider impure. As a result, you will
                                            rarely find dogs in Antaisaka villages. <br> <br>

                                            Circumcision is also a moment of great celebration among the Antaisaka and
                                            takes place between June and September.
                                            According to tradition, the hosting family offers a zebu to the village, and
                                            meat must be plentiful during this
                                            occasion, which also serves to reinforce social status. <br><br>

                                            The Antaisaka are a polygamous society where women are given little or no
                                            consideration. An ancient custom allows a man
                                            to leave his wife and children at any time without any obligation and take
                                            another wife. Women also do not have
                                            inheritance rights, even to land owned by their own parents.</p>

                                        <p>The Antaisaka are great farmers, with men spending most of their time in the
                                            fields and various agricultural processing
                                            plants. Being in a coastal region, they also engage in fishing to supplement
                                            their income, often assisted by their
                                            children. <br><br>

                                            Another common activity is transporting locals and tourists by rickshaw,
                                            especially among the youth, who are
                                            increasingly abandoning fishing. Agricultural production is mainly geared
                                            towards export, including vanilla, cloves,
                                            pepper, and coffee. Subsistence farming also plays a significant role, with
                                            crops such as rice, sweet potatoes, tropical
                                            fruits, and cassava.</p>

                                            fish, and crustaceans. Deeply connected to
                                            the sea, they also used it as a refuge in times of conflict with other
                                            ethnic groups. At the first sign of danger, the
                                            Vezo would rush to their dugout canoes and flee offshore for safety.
                                            <br><br>

                                            Known for their exceptional skill in navigating their boats, the Vezo are
                                            mainly concentrated between Toliara (Tuléar)
                                            and Morombe, though their presence extends from Androka to Mahajanga. Today,
                                            as semi-nomadic people, they are
                                            increasingly facing the depletion of marine resources, leading many to adopt
                                            a more sedentary lifestyle, moving away
                                            from the sea and settling in larger cities.

                                        <h5>Customs and traditions</h5>
                                        <p>If the Vezo people are believed to have Austronesian origins, they themselves
                                            claim to be descendants of the union
                                            between a fisherman and a mermaid. For the Vezo, the sea is a nurturing
                                            mother, and they only fish for what they need to
                                            survive. Fishing more than necessary is considered a transgression that
                                            could cost them their lives such as a shipwreck
                                            or a decline in fish availability on future fishing trips. <br><br>

                                            Vezo customs and traditions are always connected to the sea, such as the
                                            turtle fishing ritual, which involves a
                                            ceremonial practice before consumption. Once caught, the turtle must first
                                            be sacrificed on a dedicated altar before its
                                            meat can be consumed, and only by men. <br><br>

                                            As for Vezo funerary art, their tombs are easily recognizable by the erotic
                                            wooden statues erected above the graves
                                            scattered across the dunes. The placement of these statues follows specific
                                            rules. For instance, the statue of a man
                                            must always face northeast, whereas the statue of a woman must face
                                            southwest.</p>
                                        <h5>Daily Life</h5>
                                        <p>The Vezo fish all year round, with more intensive fishing between June and
                                            September during the winter season, known as
                                            asutsy. During this time, they migrate offshore to the many small islands
                                            where fish seek refuge away from the coast. <br><br>

                                            For centuries, the Vezo have built their own boats following a precise
                                            design, decorating them with brightly colored or
                                            pure white sails. These pirogues serve as their primary mode of transport,
                                            used not only for fishing but also for
                                            carrying goods. Meanwhile, women and children are busy drying fish and
                                            preparing the nets while waiting for the
                                            fishermen to return. <br><br>

                                            In addition to net fishing, the Vezo also practice hook fishing, seine
                                            fishing, and shore fishing for shellfish, sea
                                            urchins, octopuses, and more. Besides ancestor worship, some Vezo also
                                            perform circumcision ceremonies, healing rituals
                                            known as bilo, and marriage rites called *oritse* and fandeha.</p>

                                        <p>An ethnic group settled in the Tolagnaro region, better known as
                                            Fort-Dauphin, the Antanosy are known for being brave
                                            warriors.</p>
                                        <h5>Origin and Geographical Location</h5>
                                        <p>History tells that in 1643, the Portuguese, who had come to establish a
                                            trading post in the region, kidnapped the
                                            youngest son of King Andriantsiambany, the ruler of the Antanosy people.
                                            This abduction followed the king’s refusal to
                                            send his eldest son to India for education and conversion to Christianity.
                                            Since this event, the Antanosy continuously
                                            waged war against the Portuguese colonizers, who eventually relocated to
                                            Bourbon Island, now known as Réunion Island. <br><br>

                                            The arrival of French settlers and the return of the kidnapped prince to
                                            rule the Antanosy kingdom helped ease tensions.
                                            However, the Antanosy have remained wary of foreigners ever since. While
                                            many Antanosy stayed along the coast, some
                                            migrated westward in 1845 to escape the Merina and settled along the banks
                                            of the Onilahy River. Their arrival was
                                            marked by numerous expeditions against the Bara and Mahafaly people in an
                                            effort to claim the region. <br><br>

                                            It is worth noting that the cultures of the Antandroy, known as "The People
                                            of the Thorns" in the Grand South, and the
                                            Antanosy are closely linked due to their shared origins. The Antandroy
                                            kingdom was founded by Prince Andriamanare, the
                                            son of King Andriankoantane, ruler of the ZafiRaminia in Fort-Dauphin.</p>
                                        <h5>Customs and Traditions</h5>
                                        <p>Practicing ancestor worship through a unique funerary rite, the Antanosy take
                                            the deceased far from the village to be
                                            buried in a <b>kibory</b>, a collective tomb. This ensures that the deceased
                                            is
                                            not disturbed, but to keep their memory
                                            alive, a standing stone is erected in the village. This commemorative stone
                                            is believed to house the spirit of the
                                            deceased and is often the focus of rituals to seek blessings and protection.
                                            Before each burial, a funeral vigil is
                                            held, during which the *Sarandra*, the traditional Antanosy funeral chant,
                                            is sung. <br><br>

                                            The Antanosy also practice a possession ritual known as *Bilo*, which
                                            involves calling upon spirits through music and
                                            dance. This ritual is performed to invoke a spirit, usually for healing
                                            purposes or to resolve personal or communal
                                            issues.</p>

                                            Fort-Dauphin, famous for its lobsters, hosts an annual

                                            bring in seafood such as shrimp, crabs, tuna,
                                            and lobsters, women excel in basket weaving and the weaving of lamba, the
                                            traditional fabric. They also assist men in

                                            their income, some Antanosy engage in cattle
                                            farming, blacksmithing, and even carpentry.</p>

                                            the Menarandra and Onilahy rivers, about 150 km from Toliara.</p>
                                        <h5>Origin and Geographical Location</h5>
                                        <p>A semi-desert region with vegetation consisting of various succulent plants,
                                            the Mahafaly have skillfully used this
                                            natural environment to protect their villages. Historically, small clans
                                            lived in the area before the arrival of the
                                            Maroseranana Sakalava and the Anosy dynasty in the 15th century. The
                                            Mahafaly were renowned as formidable warriors. <br><br>

                                            According to different legends, the word Mahafaly can mean either "that
                                            which is taboo" or "that which brings
                                            happiness," though the first interpretation is considered more likely. Still
                                            living in small groups, their dialect is
                                            derived from languages spoken in Borneo.</p>
                                        <h5>Customs and Traditions</h5>
                                        <p>Like most Malagasy ethnic groups, the Mahafaly people practice ancestor
                                            worship.
                                            For them, everything acquired during a
                                            person’s lifetime must be sacrificed to the ancestors and the creator upon
                                            their
                                            death. <br><br>

                                            The importance of the deceased is reflected in the number of zebus
                                            slaughtered
                                            in their honor, with the horns displayed
                                            on their tomb. Funerals serve a dual purpose: strengthening connections with
                                            the
                                            afterlife as well as reinforcing ties
                                            between different family lineages. During the ceremony, a ritual known as
                                            joro
                                            is performed, which involves sacrificing
                                            a zebu. <br><br>

                                            Another important ancestral practice is savatse, or circumcision. A male
                                            child’s
                                            circumcision grants him the right to be
                                            buried in the family tomb and to be officially recognized by his entire
                                            clan.
                                            Traditionally, each village is governed by
                                            a Zakan-draza, a council of elders who are consulted for conflict resolution
                                            and
                                            major events.</p>
                                        <p><b>Ceremonies and Important Dates</b><br>

                                            <b>June</b>: Savatse – Traditional circumcision ceremony. <br>
                                            <b>Between August and December</b>: Havoria – The "turning of the dead"

                                            where ancestors' remains are exhumed,
                                            rewrapped, and honored.

                                        <h5>Daily life</h5>
                                        <p>Polygamous by tradition, the Mahafaly live in houses made from natural
                                            materials such as wood, branches, straw, or
                                            reeds. Their diet mainly consists of maize, cassava, lentils, wild tubers,
                                            and prickly pears. The Mahafaly people are
                                            also distinguished by their unique hairstyles and tattoos. <br><br>

                                            Although La Maison du Mohair once closed its doors, the craft has been
                                            revived thanks to independent artisans and female
                                            workers engaged in a commercial network. The famous Ampanihy rug remains the
                                            region’s signature product. <br><br>

                                            Additionally, the Mahafaly land is home to gold and gemstone mines.
                                            Agropastoralists migrate with their cattle in search
                                            of new grazing lands. On market days, they travel to Ampanihy, the regional
                                            capital, to trade and barter goods. <br><br>

                                            The Mahafaly region also boasts two natural reserves that promote tourism.
                                            The Bezaha Mahafaly reserve serves as a
                                            research and training center for biodiversity conservation in Madagascar,
                                            housing a rich variety of flora and fauna.
                                            Meanwhile, Tsimanampetsotsa features a striking milky-white salt lake, among
                                            other natural wonders.</p>

                                        <p>A nomadic pastoralist people, the Antandroy, or "People of the Thorns," are
                                            settled in the far south of Madagascar.</p>
                                        <h5>Origin and Geographical Location</h5>
                                        <p>Believed to have Arab, Jewish, and Indo Pakistani origins, the Antandroy
                                            people are primarily rooted in a strict
                                            pastoral culture. They speak a Malayo Polynesian dialect and inhabit one of
                                            the most arid regions of Madagascar, Androy.
                                            Originally, the inhabitants of this land were the Karimbola and Mahandrovato
                                            peoples. <br> <br>

                                            In the 15th century, these two kingdoms were conquered by Prince
                                            Andriamanare from the Fort Dauphin region. He decided
                                            to settle there and unite them into a single kingdom, forming the Antandroy
                                            people. However, this unity collapsed in the
                                            18th century due to repeated invasions, leading to ongoing internal
                                            conflicts frequently marked by cattle raids—the
                                            primary source of wealth in the region.</p>
                                        <h5>Customs and Traditions</h5>
                                        <p>Renowned as brave warriors, the Antandroy people are deeply committed to
                                            ancestral traditions. Their territory extends
                                            from Orombe to Bekily and Fort-Dauphin, where they practice ancestor
                                            worship, with zebus playing a central role.
                                            Considered a symbol of wealth, the number of zebus owned reflects one’s
                                            social status and reputation. Upon death, part
                                            or all of the deceased’s cattle may be slaughtered and consumed by the
                                            family and tribe. The horns are then used to
                                            decorate the tomb, which varies in size according to the individual’s
                                            wealth. <br><br>

                                            Masters of divination, the Antandroy always seek guidance from their Ombiasy
                                            (traditional diviners) for major events,
                                            including the construction of tombs. The coffin is made from two
                                            hollowed-out tree trunks, which are vigorously shaken
                                            during a funeral dance before burial. Notably, royal tombs can reach up to
                                            50 meters in length! <br><br>

                                            These tombs are also adorned with Aloalo (wooden sculptures) and funerary
                                            statues, though they are often targeted by
                                            looters. The Bilo dance, a ritual trance dance, is widely practiced among
                                            the Antandroy to supposedly expel evil
                                            spirits. Another distinctive cultural element is the Beko, an a cappella
                                            funeral chant composed of litanies to accompany
                                            the spirit of the deceased on their journey to the afterlife.</p>
                                        <h5>Daily life</h5>
                                        <p>Settled in one of the driest regions of Madagascar, the Antandroy practice
                                            very little subsistence farming due to the
                                            scarcity of water, cultivating only small amounts of cassava, sweet
                                            potatoes, and maize. On Mondays, market day in
                                            Ambovombe, the capital of Androy, one can find sagaies (traditional spears),
                                            Antandroy hats made from zebu hump leather,
                                            water sapphires, and a wide array of silver jewelry. The Antandroy are well
                                            known as skilled silversmiths and experts in
                                            tattooing. <br><br>

                                            Although cattle and goat herding remain their primary livelihood, an
                                            increasing number of young people and women are
                                            engaging in sapphire mining in Tsihombe, about 50 km from Beloha. Women in
                                            Ambondro also practice the weaving of lamba
                                            mena, a traditional wild silk fabric, which is then sold at markets across
                                            Androy. Notably, some Antandroy adhere to a
                                            taboo against eating pork.</p>
